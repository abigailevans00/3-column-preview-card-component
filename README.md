## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements





## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned more about CSS Grid with grid-template-columns. I created a mobile-responsive design that turns into a single column. I improved on structuring my HTML.


### Continued development

I would improve this by learning alternative solutions for positioning as well as finding a better way to wrap the text.
